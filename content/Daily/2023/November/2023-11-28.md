## [[Kubernetes]]

- Doing labs for CKA exam Kubernetes
  - Node affinity vs Taints and tolerations
  - Resource requirements
    - Resource requests
    ```yaml
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app-image
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "4Gi" # Can also use 4000 Mi
            cpu: 2 # (same as 2000m)
          limits:
            memory: "8Gi"
            cpu: 4
    ```
  - If a pod oversteps its memory limit, it gets terminated with OutOfMemory
  - For CPU, the application wil get throttled
  - Good practice for CPU is to set requests but no limits, because
    a pod can use the available CPU, but a new pod is still guarenteed
    the amount it requests
  - Good practice for memory is to set requests and limits, because
  if Kubernetes assigns too much memory to a pod, the only way to retreive is
  to kill the pod
  - It's possible to create Limit range settings for default resource settings
  in a namespace
  ```yaml
  # similar for memory
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: LimitRange
  metadata:
    name: default-cpu-constraint
  spec:
    limits:
    - default:
        cpu: 500m
      defaultRequest:
        cpu: 500m
      max:
        cpu: "1"
      min:
        cpu: 100m
      type: Container
  ```
  - Possible to set quotas at a namespace level to set hard limits
  for the amount of CPU or memory consumed by all pods in a certain namespace
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  ...
  ```
  - When editing pods you can edit only a subset of parameters.
  When editing a Deployment, all parts of a pod definition can be edited
  and the pods will be automatically recreated.
